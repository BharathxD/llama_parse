This is in part because they can draw upon a vast store of data, leveraging the massive computing power available today in the cloud. But what I think is more exciting is the real, tangible impact that technology like this can drive. AI, together with the power of cloud and machine learning, has enormous potential. Much like we led the charge on password spray detection, two-factor authentication enforcement, and managed device health, we have an opportunity to demonstrate how responsible AI has the potential to positively transform the security landscape.\\n\\nAt Microsoft, we are developing first- and third-party solutions for our ever-increasing number of enterprise, government, and consumer customers and partners. We have seen developer activity double in the last three years, and it is up by over 31 percent in the last year alone. This trend will accelerate as developers adopt AI powered development tools like GitHub Copilot. This will require a commensurate increase in threat models, code reviews, compliance attestations, and app/ infrastructure assurance to secure resilience.\\n\\nAn important contribution we can make is to continue to evolve our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) rules and engineering compliance. This will ensure continued focus on secure engineering practices.\\n\\nWe recently simplified, updated, and automated our SDL and Operational Security Assurance requirements into a single standard. We will increase our compliance with the modernized SDL through enhanced training, automation, and reporting.\\n\\nWe will also deploy Security CoPilot—our new AI powered incident response assistant—across our incident response teams, so that we can both gain the benefit of AI in addressing security incidents, and so we can improve this valuable new capability by providing our development teams with feedback based on our real-world experience.\\n\\nBased on actions needed to meet the growing threat landscape, our approach for the next year will focus on bringing to bear AI in combating threats while also embracing the three SDL principles of Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure in Deployment (SD3). While it may sound simple, this will require all of us to prioritize and collaborate to successfully execute across everything we do, every day.\\n\\nBret Arsenault\\nChief Information Security Officer\\n\\n## We have defined three priority areas in which we will invest to ensure that we embed SD3:\\n\\n1. Be Secure by Design and address the technical debt. Bring systems up to current standards and levels of inspection and security. Address the need for security training for developers, threat modeling for all services, complete Code QL and Network Security.\\n\\n2. Create efficiency in current systems. Unify critical tools and systems, including the numerous Identity systems, SOC/IR, case management, and risk management. Create common tooling and mechanisms to ensure compliance with Secure by Default and Secure in Deployment.\\n\\n3. Future-proof the company, focusing on AI. We need to invest resources in how we identify the new risks (Secure by Design) and operate the environments (Secure by Default and Secure in Deployment). We will leverage AI to improve security operations and define the standards to ensure we build trust and transparency across all the customer facing implementations as well.\\n\\n| 23% |\\n|-----|\\n| annual rise in the cases processed by the Microsoft Security Response Center and Security Operations Center teams. |', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.611285698245899),\n",

At Microsoft, as we work to create a future for everyone, we have a responsibility to support people's digital safety and defend against the challenges presented by technologically enabled bad actors. We also need to uphold human rights, close divides, and partner on collaborative initiatives protecting people and systems' digital security.\\n\\nAcross the globe, Microsoft works closely with our customers and partners to provide security guidance and tools to improve cyber resilience and protect the integrity of digital services, especially in the face of ever-evolving threats. For example, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center released a report highlighting the increase in Russia's espionage attacks and their development of new forms of ransomware in March 2023, and Microsoft announced its investigation of an Iranian cyberattack against Albania's government in September 2022. Cybercriminals and threat actors are constantly innovating their strategies to leverage technological advancements—but so are we. Working together and providing industry-leading solutions are core to our collective defense efforts.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we offer insights into our collective defense strategies, including support for the World Economic Forum's Cybercrime Atlas initiative and engagement in the Open Source Security Foundation. We also highlight strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations to overcome attacks like Volt Typhoon and combat the illicit use of tools like Cobalt Strike. From our role as a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) to our partnership with TruePic to create Project Providence, we show how we're working together in new ways to bolster our customers' digital defense capabilities, reduce their cyber risks, and further collaborative projects, such as documenting evidence of cultural heritage site destruction in Ukraine. As part of our commitment to defending democracy, Microsoft's non-partisan election protection efforts extend globally through work with organizations like the International Foundation for Election Systems, to help weave far-reaching networks that enable the sharing of best practices. Our partnerships to protect elections span work with nonprofits including the National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, and Freedom House. These are just a few of the many ways in which Microsoft is working cooperatively with leading organizations on innovative solutions to best meet the challenges facing our world today. We are proud to collaborate with other leading technology companies and cross-sector partners to advance open-source security, curb cybercrime, safeguard democracy, and strengthen media content.\\n\\nMicrosoft remains committed to supporting a healthy information ecosystem and addressing evolving threats within the digital spaces in which we operate. Core to this work are diverse strategic partnerships and trained cybersecurity professionals.\\n\\nThe shortage of cybersecurity professionals and the need for AI skills, as discussed in depth later in this chapter, pose significant challenges in today's rapidly changing digital landscape. Robust partnerships with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, governments, and other businesses are central to our collective defense efforts and skill-building resources that can enable people to adapt amidst constantly shifting challenges. As the threat landscape evolves, we look forward to continuing these and other collective defense engagements with valued partners.\\n\\nTeresa Hutson\\nCorporate Vice President, Technology for Fundamental Rights\\n\\n> Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles mapping index on page 125.\\n\\nThough threats to the information ecosystem have always existed, the tactics adversaries deploy in the digital age are constantly evolving.

      "During Microsoft Incident Response engagements, customer environments have been found to lack mitigations that range from the simple to the more complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the goal of all mitigations is to make environments more resilient to cyberattacks, customers may not always have the resources to implement all of them, and a return on mitigation framework is helpful for prioritization. Generally speaking, the lower the resources and effort involved, the higher the return on mitigation (ROM). As an example of a high return, consider a simple solution to implement: context-based MFA protection. This solution is highly effective in preventing initial access (high security value) but very simple to implement (low effort). When implemented, this solution effectively prevents initial access by providing more context around the authentication attempt, such as geographic location and the application used. The additional context can be combined with requiring the user to enter a number (number matching) to complete MFA to further improve sign-in security.\n",

      "\n",
      "Microsoft is an advocate for software bills of materials (SBOMs), which provide software transparency to customers. SBOMs enable organizations to manage their supply chain risk for the software that's deployed across their enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2019, we have contributed to cross-industry working groups, international standards, and open-source tools aiming to advance SBOM generation, sharing, and consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our SBOM generation tool detects dependencies across numerous ecosystems and is available as open source. We generate SBOMs using the Linux Foundation's Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) 2.x JSON format. Microsoft Defender for IoT firmware analysis allows customers to generate an SBOM and identify potential security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "NuGet plans to support SBOM generation natively within its ecosystem so that every future NuGet package would have an SBOM,11 and GitHub now allows exporting SBOMs from repositories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations should prepare now for consuming and managing SBOMs from their suppliers. Most, if not all, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools can produce SBOMs today, so commercial software suppliers should have the capability to produce and share SBOMs. When the next incident such as Log4j occurs, having an SBOM for the software deployed across your enterprise enables you to answer the questions \"Am I affected?\" and \"What is affected?\" This empowers organizations to understand where the vulnerability is within their environment so they can understand their level of exposure, as well as prepare for deploying emergency patches if applicable.\n",

      "This drives us to continuously evaluate our security posture through our SDL continuous assurance approach rather than assessing compliance at a single point in time like other audits. We employ automated tools like static analyzers, web scanners, and open-source scanners to assess our code and development infrastructure and use manual attestations for non-automated requirements. By analyzing assessment results from different perspectives, we can identify trends and intervene when necessary. This approach helps us prepare for new requirements by introducing draft requirements that generate reports without alerting developers.\n",

      "### Celebrating 20 years of the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)\n",
      "\n",
      "We prioritize security in every aspect of our products and services to ensure resilience. The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), introduced in 2004, is designed to identify and minimize risks throughout the product lifecycle, meet compliance requirements, and deliver reliable solutions to our customers.8\n",
      "\n",
      "We have evolved the SDL to adapt to cloud computing, AI/ML advancements, the changing threat landscape, and regulatory demands like US Executive Order 14028 (\"Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity\"). Our latest SDL updates focus on simplicity, automation, and providing developers with further guidance and guardrails.\n",
      "\n",
      "We leverage enforcement mechanisms within our development and cloud platforms to impose SDL requirements early in the development lifecycle. For example, we scan code for potential exposure of sensitive information before it is committed to version control and ensure that code is reviewed by someone other than the author before being committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also invest in finding vulnerable code across our products and services. CodeQL is a powerful static analysis tool which we use to identify security issues and potential vulnerabilities in programming languages. We centrally store source code snapshots generated at build time in CodeQL Central and run predefined rules or ad hoc queries against them. These rules help identify known vulnerable code patterns, capture evidence of secure coding practices, and highlight areas affected by emerging requirements like Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach has significantly reduced the feedback loop when new vulnerabilities are discovered, providing actionable results to developers within hours. When these CodeQL rules mature or require urgent release, as in the case of Solarwinds,9 we open-source them and incorporate them into the CodeQL product to benefit all users.\n",
      "\n",
      "While automation plays a vital role, we also prioritize developer security training, threat modelling, and specialized reviews in areas like AI/ML and cryptography. These efforts provide knowledge which feeds back into our SDL guidance and automation, allowing us to scale while ensuring security. We also share knowledge externally through published guidance, open-sourced tools, and new features in our developer and cloud platforms to foster a more collaborative and resilient environment for all.\n",

It includes the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform, developer identities, and all connected services used by our developers (such as Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces). The model was informed by real-world threat reports and calculated risk scores. Based on the results, we made several security investments: adopting secure boot for our build machines, improving inventory and update processes for build tools, and validating the integrity of our software bills of materials (SBOMs) at release time.\n",

      "Our security measures go beyond just identity, devices, and access. We follow Zero Trust principles to secure our developers. This includes using phish-resistant MFA, requiring managed healthy devices to access DevOps web apps, replacing personal access tokens (PAT) bearer tokens with managed identities, and applying the least privilege access principle to managing version control and build configuration. We also perform periodic user access reviews to ensure privileges are only granted to those with a business need and use just-in-time (JIT) permission controls for administration tasks.\n",

      "To address IoT and OT security threats, governments and industry are advancing multiple standards and policy initiatives. As the market is changing, governments are moving toward mandatory requirements, where noncompliance could result in losing access to a market segment or financial penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "These requirements will create significant market pressure on IoT and OT device manufacturers to adopt cybersecurity best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, the Biden administration announced a voluntary cyber labeling program for smart devices to protect American consumers intended to be \"up and running\" in 2024. The program will evaluate products against criteria NIST develops, such as the consumer IoT core baseline profile NIST IR 8425 published in September 2022 and requirements for consumer grade routers to be completed by the end of 2023. The US National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan set a completion date prior to November 2023 for the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to propose Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements for procurement of IoT devices by US federal agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill empowers government ministers to specify security requirements for consumer connectable products with which businesses involved in making the products available to UK consumers must comply. Draft security requirements for connectable products have been published, and the UK's consumer connectable products security regime will come into effect on April 29, 2024. The security requirements mandate that manufacturers stop using default passwords in products, establish a vulnerability disclosure policy, and provide transparency about the minimum length of time that the product will receive security updates. While US and UK efforts are focused on consumer products, we believe they will drive improved security in the OT market as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU delegated act to the Radio Equipment Directive will enforce mandatory security requirements in mid-2024 for wireless devices with the goals of improving network resilience, protecting consumers' privacy, and reducing the risk of monetary fraud. Cybersecurity requirements in the Radio Equipment Directive are likely to be overshadowed by the proposed EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), anticipated to be finalized in 2024. Microsoft believes the CRA could have serious implications for product cybersecurity, similar to how the EU General Data Protection Regulation promulgated privacy requirements. The CRA envisions mandatory essential cybersecurity requirements for nearly all connected products with digital elements to be sold in the European Union, including hardware, standalone software, and associated remote data processing. Requirements are structured to improve security throughout the lifecycle of products, including design, development, and support. The CRA includes conformity assessment and product security labeling through the application of the European CE marking system.\n",

      "Experiences based on large language models, like ChatGPT, have taken the world by storm in the last year. This is in part because they can draw upon a vast store of data, leveraging the massive computing power available today in the cloud. But what I think is more exciting is the real, tangible impact that technology like this can drive. AI, together with the power of cloud and machine learning, has enormous potential. Much like we led the charge on password spray detection, two-factor authentication enforcement, and managed device health, we have an opportunity to demonstrate how responsible AI has the potential to positively transform the security landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Microsoft, we are developing first- and third-party solutions for our ever-increasing number of enterprise, government, and consumer customers and partners. We have seen developer activity double in the last three years, and it is up by over 31 percent in the last year alone. This trend will accelerate as developers adopt AI powered development tools like GitHub Copilot. This will require a commensurate increase in threat models, code reviews, compliance attestations, and app/ infrastructure assurance to secure resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important contribution we can make is to continue to evolve our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) rules and engineering compliance. This will ensure continued focus on secure engineering practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently simplified, updated, and automated our SDL and Operational Security Assurance requirements into a single standard. We will increase our compliance with the modernized SDL through enhanced training, automation, and reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also deploy Security CoPilot—our new AI powered incident response assistant—across our incident response teams, so that we can both gain the benefit of AI in addressing security incidents, and so we can improve this valuable new capability by providing our development teams with feedback based on our real-world experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on actions needed to meet the growing threat landscape, our approach for the next year will focus on bringing to bear AI in combating threats while also embracing the three SDL principles of Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure in Deployment (SD3). While it may sound simple, this will require all of us to prioritize and collaborate to successfully execute across everything we do, every day.\n",

      "The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\n",

As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\n",

Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n",

Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices.

      "In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n",

Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\n",

A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n",

A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations.

      "Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.\n",

      "Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\n",

      "The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\n",

      "On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\n",

This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n",

      "\n",
      "We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\n",

We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies' ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n",

As an example of a high return, consider a simple solution to implement: context-based MFA protection. This solution is highly effective in preventing initial access (high security value) but very simple to implement (low effort). When implemented, this solution effectively prevents initial access by providing more context around the authentication attempt, such as geographic location and the application used. The additional context can be combined with requiring the user to enter a number (number matching) to complete MFA to further improve sign-in security.\n",

      "In the United States, the Biden administration announced a voluntary cyber labeling program for smart devices to protect American consumers intended to be \"up and running\" in 2024. The program will evaluate products against criteria NIST develops, such as the consumer IoT core baseline profile NIST IR 8425 published in September 2022 and requirements for consumer grade routers to be completed by the end of 2023. The US National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan set a completion date prior to November 2023 for the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to propose Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements for procurement of IoT devices by US federal agencies.\n",

      "The UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill empowers government ministers to specify security requirements for consumer connectable products with which businesses involved in making the products available to UK consumers must comply. Draft security requirements for connectable products have been published, and the UK's consumer connectable products security regime will come into effect on April 29, 2024. The security requirements mandate that manufacturers stop using default passwords in products, establish a vulnerability disclosure policy, and provide transparency about the minimum length of time that the product will receive security updates. While US and UK efforts are focused on consumer products, we believe they will drive improved security in the OT market as well.\n",

      "The EU delegated act to the Radio Equipment Directive will enforce mandatory security requirements in mid-2024 for wireless devices with the goals of improving network resilience, protecting consumers' privacy, and reducing the risk of monetary fraud. Cybersecurity requirements in the Radio Equipment Directive are likely to be overshadowed by the proposed EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), anticipated to be finalized in 2024. Microsoft believes the CRA could have serious implications for product cybersecurity, similar to how the EU General Data Protection Regulation promulgated privacy requirements. The CRA envisions mandatory essential cybersecurity requirements for nearly all connected products with digital elements to be sold in the European Union, including hardware, standalone software, and associated remote data processing. Requirements are structured to improve security throughout the lifecycle of products, including design, development, and support. The CRA includes conformity assessment and product security labeling through the application of the European CE marking system.\n",

CISA will most likely next issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that will outline its proposed regulatory requirements for cyber incident reporting and solicit public feedback on its proposal. | The Transportation Security Agency (TSA) increased cybersecurity requirements for the transportation sector. A security directive mandated passenger and freight railroad carriers to develop network segmentation controls, implement access control measures, use continuous monitoring and detection, and apply security patches promptly to ensure safe operation of operational technology systems in case of IT system incidents. | The EU implemented NIS2, CER, and DORA to enhance critical infrastructure resilience against cyber and physical threats. NIS2 mandates incident response, crisis management, cybersecurity risk management, hygiene, and training. CER strengthens critical infrastructure resilience to various threats. DORA requires financial entities to report incidents, conduct testing, and monitor third-party risks. It also oversees \"critical\" ICT third-party service providers. EU member states must transpose NIS2 and CER by October 2024 and apply DORA by January 2025. | TSA further increased cybersecurity requirements, including TSA-regulated airports and aircraft operators.

CISA will most likely next issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that will outline its proposed regulatory requirements for cyber incident reporting and solicit public feedback on its proposal. | The Transportation Security Agency (TSA) increased cybersecurity requirements for the transportation sector. A security directive mandated passenger and freight railroad carriers to develop network segmentation controls, implement access control measures, use continuous monitoring and detection, and apply security patches promptly to ensure safe operation of operational technology systems in case of IT system incidents. | The EU implemented NIS2, CER, and DORA to enhance critical infrastructure resilience against cyber and physical threats. NIS2 mandates incident response, crisis management, cybersecurity risk management, hygiene, and training. CER strengthens critical infrastructure resilience to various threats. DORA requires financial entities to report incidents, conduct testing, and monitor third-party risks. It also oversees \"critical\" ICT third-party service providers.

      "As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives, it brings both great opportunities and significant risks to our fundamental rights and ability to engage in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we develop technology, we must be thoughtful, champion access to critical services, and build equity into our solutions. At Microsoft, as we work to create a future for everyone, we have a responsibility to support people's digital safety and defend against the challenges presented by technologically enabled bad actors. We also need to uphold human rights, close divides, and partner on collaborative initiatives protecting people and systems' digital security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the globe, Microsoft works closely with our customers and partners to provide security guidance and tools to improve cyber resilience and protect the integrity of digital services, especially in the face of ever-evolving threats. For example, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center released a report highlighting the increase in Russia's espionage attacks and their development of new forms of ransomware in March 2023, and Microsoft announced its investigation of an Iranian cyberattack against Albania's government in September 2022. Cybercriminals and threat actors are constantly innovating their strategies to leverage technological advancements—but so are we. Working together and providing industry-leading solutions are core to our collective defense efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter, we offer insights into our collective defense strategies, including support for the World Economic Forum's Cybercrime Atlas initiative and engagement in the Open Source Security Foundation. We also highlight strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations to overcome attacks like Volt Typhoon and combat the illicit use of tools like Cobalt Strike. From our role as a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) to our partnership with TruePic to create Project Providence, we show how we're working together in new ways to bolster our customers' digital defense capabilities, reduce their cyber risks, and further collaborative projects, such as documenting evidence of cultural heritage site destruction in Ukraine. As part of our commitment to defending democracy, Microsoft's non-partisan election protection efforts extend globally through work with organizations like the International Foundation for Election Systems, to help weave far-reaching networks that enable the sharing of best practices. Our partnerships to protect elections span work with nonprofits including the National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, and Freedom House. These are just a few of the many ways in which Microsoft is working cooperatively with leading organizations on innovative solutions to best meet the challenges facing our world today. We are proud to collaborate with other leading technology companies and cross-sector partners to advance open-source security, curb cybercrime, safeguard democracy, and strengthen media content.\n",

      "Microsoft remains committed to supporting a healthy information ecosystem and addressing evolving threats within the digital spaces in which we operate. Core to this work are diverse strategic partnerships and trained cybersecurity professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shortage of cybersecurity professionals and the need for AI skills, as discussed in depth later in this chapter, pose significant challenges in today's rapidly changing digital landscape. Robust partnerships with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, governments, and other businesses are central to our collective defense efforts and skill-building resources that can enable people to adapt amidst constantly shifting challenges. As the threat landscape evolves, we look forward to continuing these and other collective defense engagements with valued partners.\n",

      "\n",
      "We believe every individual and company around the world should be empowered to meet its security needs. Achieving this will require a collective global effort as we harness the power of partnership to strengthen our defenses together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strength in numbers. Stronger together. Together we stand. Societies around the world recognize the benefits of collective behavior. The power of multistakeholder partnerships in cybersecurity, too, cannot be ignored as we seek to answer the question, \"What we can do to ensure a more safe and secure world for everyone on the planet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual organizations are often focused on safeguarding their own data and systems and protecting their customers, constituents, and communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "But partnerships act as a force multiplier for everyone involved in cybersecurity. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders—including government agencies, private sector entities, academia, non-profits, and other organizations—are crucial in building resilient defenses against cyber threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The cyber poverty line\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the need for collaboration, it is useful to consider the concept of a \"cyber poverty line.\" In the same way that governments and economists establish a social poverty line to determine a bare minimum standard of living, the cyber poverty line is the minimum level of resources required for adequate protection from cyber threats. As we ponder the implication of the existence of a cyber poverty line, important questions begin to surface. How, exactly, do we quantify the cyber poverty line? Who is below it and how can we work together to support them to rise above it? These questions underscore the imperative of partnership in cybersecurity and serve as the genesis of meaningful conversations we must have.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Public-private partnerships, policy, and standards\n",
      "\n",
      "The opportunities for partnership across the public and private sectors, policy organizations, and standards bodies are multi-dimensional. From ensuring the technology community is building safer, more secure technology and collaborating on threat intelligence and trends to developing common standards to take down and block the tools cybercriminals use, strong and bi-directional partnerships between organizations are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as any individual company's shareholders would like it to be so, no one technology company can solve or overcome every cybersecurity challenge. Partnerships across the technology community are an absolute necessity to ensure organizations of all types and sizes, in every industry and region, can protect themselves. This means working together to push the boundaries of innovation, ensuring technical integration of products in the security space and addressing the end-to-end security needs of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-profit, academia, and research\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-profit, academia, and research organizations play a crucial role in advancing cybersecurity. By collaborating with industry partners, they bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Academic institutions contribute to cybersecurity research, develop innovative technologies, and educate the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. Collaborative research projects and initiatives between academia, non-profits, and industry promote innovation and help tackle emerging cyber threats effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential that stakeholders recognize their shared responsibility and actively engage in partnerships that enhance cybersecurity. History has already shown that by working together, we can build a safer digital future for individuals, organizations and nations—but there is so much more to be done.\n",

As cyberthreats evolve, trusted relationships improve collective knowledge, drive resilience, and inform mitigation guidance across the security ecosystem on a global scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft's unparalleled visibility of the threat landscape provides us with unique insight. To extend this visibility, we have developed a community of strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations as we aim to more fully understand and defend against common adversaries. These partnerships which span across the security industry and government research organizations from around the world have become a crucial part of our threat hunting process. The mutual benefit to both parties adds unique value that improves our ability to protect our shared customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of our analysis of Volt Typhoon attacks against organizations in Guam and the United States, these partnerships helped us expand and analyze more deeply the telemetry we were seeing within our customer environments. Working across private industry to share our research and extending this visibility to government partners then allowed us to rapidly understand the real and potential impact of Volt Typhoon activity and craft a collective response. The outcome of this and many other collaborations have resulted in better protections across the security ecosystem, more comprehensive mitigation guidance, and deeper relationships that help us respond to evolving threats on a global scale.\n",

      "Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\"DPF\") has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\n",

      "Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market.\n",

      "The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\n",

      "Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\n",

      "\n",
      "The security of our products and services is important in our customers' decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero day\") vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer's use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers' computing environments.\n",

      "To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The IoT's great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions.

This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (\"EU\"), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\n",

      "\n",
      "We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\n",

      "\n",
      "When we develop technology, we must be thoughtful, champion access to critical services, and build equity into our solutions. At Microsoft, as we work to create a future for everyone, we have a responsibility to support people's digital safety and defend against the challenges presented by technologically enabled bad actors. We also need to uphold human rights, close divides, and partner on collaborative initiatives protecting people and systems' digital security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the globe, Microsoft works closely with our customers and partners to provide security guidance and tools to improve cyber resilience and protect the integrity of digital services, especially in the face of ever-evolving threats. For example, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center released a report highlighting the increase in Russia's espionage attacks and their development of new forms of ransomware in March 2023, and Microsoft announced its investigation of an Iranian cyberattack against Albania's government in September 2022. Cybercriminals and threat actors are constantly innovating their strategies to leverage technological advancements—but so are we. Working together and providing industry-leading solutions are core to our collective defense efforts.\n",

      "In this chapter, we offer insights into our collective defense strategies, including support for the World Economic Forum's Cybercrime Atlas initiative and engagement in the Open Source Security Foundation. We also highlight strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations to overcome attacks like Volt Typhoon and combat the illicit use of tools like Cobalt Strike. From our role as a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) to our partnership with TruePic to create Project Providence, we show how we're working together in new ways to bolster our customers' digital defense capabilities, reduce their cyber risks, and further collaborative projects, such as documenting evidence of cultural heritage site destruction in Ukraine. As part of our commitment to defending democracy, Microsoft's non-partisan election protection efforts extend globally through work with organizations like the International Foundation for Election Systems, to help weave far-reaching networks that enable the sharing of best practices. Our partnerships to protect elections span work with nonprofits including the National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, and Freedom House. These are just a few of the many ways in which Microsoft is working cooperatively with leading organizations on innovative solutions to best meet the challenges facing our world today. We are proud to collaborate with other leading technology companies and cross-sector partners to advance open-source security, curb cybercrime, safeguard democracy, and strengthen media content.\n",
