Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\\'s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\\n\\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\\n\\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\'s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\\n\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\n\\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\n\\n## Seasonality\\n\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\n\\n## Change in Accounting Estimate\\n\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6332591551101335), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='2c5fef28-f28b-4d77-a0ce-4522aad89f88', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 37}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\\n\\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.\\n\\nWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.\\n\\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6286661483527083), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='c3765528-a220-4613-a0bc-cd7f9769e5f3', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 38}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.\\n\\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\\n\\n36', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6237685872402895), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='8251a3d6-c338-458c-a621-db84f62a0350', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 32}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n# OPERATIONAL RISKS\\n\\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\\n\\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\\n\\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\\n\\n# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\\n\\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6205335951305998), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='bc2ac41a-6396-4457-ba8f-4a65b59238d0', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 36}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\\n\\nWe face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.\\n\\nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected.\\n\\nSource code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\\n\\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.\\n\\n# GENERAL RISKS\\n\\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\\n\\n- The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.\\n- Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.\\n- Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.\\n\\nThe proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.\\n\\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\\n\\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased.

Draft security requirements for connectable products have been published, and the UK\\'s consumer connectable products security regime will come into effect on April 29, 2024. The security requirements mandate that manufacturers stop using default passwords in products, establish a vulnerability disclosure policy, and provide transparency about the minimum length of time that the product will receive security updates. While US and UK efforts are focused on consumer products, we believe they will drive improved security in the OT market as well.\\n\\nThe EU delegated act to the Radio Equipment Directive will enforce mandatory security requirements in mid-2024 for wireless devices with the goals of improving network resilience, protecting consumers\\' privacy, and reducing the risk of monetary fraud. Cybersecurity requirements in the Radio Equipment Directive are likely to be overshadowed by the proposed EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), anticipated to be finalized in 2024. Microsoft believes the CRA could have serious implications for product cybersecurity, similar to how the EU General Data Protection Regulation promulgated privacy requirements.

Generally speaking, the lower the resources and effort involved, the higher the return on mitigation (ROM). As an example of a high return, consider a simple solution to implement: context-based MFA protection. This solution is highly effective in preventing initial access (high security value) but very simple to implement (low effort). When implemented, this solution effectively prevents initial access by providing more context around the authentication attempt, such as geographic location and the application used. The additional context can be combined with requiring the user to enter a number (number matching) to complete MFA to further improve sign-in security.\\n\\n## Return on Mitigation scoring methodology\\n\\nReturn on Mitigation score = (3x security value + 2x potential user impact) / Potential ease of implementation\\n\\n| Return on Mitigation score | Type | Percentage of users potentially impacted | Score |\\n|----------------------------|------|------------------------------------------|-------|\\n| 10 - 15 | Higher | Lower impact (<20% of users impacted) | 3 |\\n| 6 - 9 | Medium | Medium impact (Up to 50% users impacted) | 2 |\\n| 2 - 5 | Lower | Higher impact (>50% users impacted) | 1 |\\n\\n| Engagement distribution (%) by major tactic | Score | Potential ease of implementation | Score |\\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------|-------|\\n| 50 - 100 | 3 | Easy to implement (20 hours or less) | 1 |\\n| 25 - 49 | 2 | Medium (20 - 40 hours) | 2 |\\n| 0 - 24 | 1 | Harder (40+ hours) | 3 |\\n\\nWe have calculated ROM values using a formula multiplying the weighted impact of the solution or mitigation by a weighted value of the solution in terms of effectiveness (security value), and factored in the effort involved in implementing the solution.

But to secure long-term resilience, defenses must be leveraged across the globe, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that lack sufficient cybersecurity. To achieve this, we must integrate cybersecurity capacity building into global sustainable development efforts.\\n\\nWhile the role of technology is prioritized in international discussions around sustainable development, cybersecurity is often overlooked, despite its crucial role in maintaining a safe and secure digital ecosystem. Microsoft has partnered with the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, and the International Telecommunication Union in a project that aims to secure the adoption of universal cybersecurity goals and targets—the Cyber Development Goals. Inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the objective is to establish essential technical, legal, and policy frameworks to help all countries implement global cybersecurity norms.\\n\\n| Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles mapping index on page 125.\\n\\nThe project will mobilize global resources and facilitate international cooperation to strengthen cybersecurity capacity building efforts.\\n\\nThroughout 2023, we convened experts to create a multistakeholder community dedicated to promoting cybersecurity capacity building for a safe and secure digital transformation worldwide. Key initiatives include supporting the development of national cybersecurity strategies, establishing computer security incident response teams or emergency response teams, building technical and forensic expertise, enhancing critical infrastructure resilience, and developing frameworks for incident response.\\n\\nMicrosoft is investing in concrete efforts to improve global cybersecurity resilience. We have launched several initiatives focused on raising awareness, fostering information and expertise exchange on effective policies and approaches to cybersecurity.

OpenSSF Alpha-Omega began in February 2022 and is funded by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services. It aims to safeguard society by engaging directly with open-source maintainers and conducting expert analysis to improve the security of open-source software.\\n\\nThrough the \"Alpha\" component, we provide tailored funding to critical open-source projects, including the Eclipse Foundation, the Python Software Foundation, the Rust Foundation, Node.js, jQuery, ISRG, and OpenSSL. These engagements often include the appointment of a security champion to drive improvements within the organization\\'s projects and embed security in their culture and processes.\\n\\nThe \"Omega\" aspect leverages technology and security experts to scale vulnerability detection across the top 10,000 critical open-source projects. We use static analysis tools like CodeQL to identify and efficiently triage critical vulnerabilities. Responsible disclosure, often accompanied by fixes, is then shared with the maintainers.\\n\\n## Bringing S2C2F to OpenSSF\\n\\nWhen combined with the fact that attacks targeting open source software (OSS) have grown 742 percent on average, securing how developers consume OSS is arguably the most important aspect of any organization\\'s software supply chain.\\n\\nWe recently published and contributed the Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F) to the OpenSSF, making it available for any development team or organization to adopt. It is a set of requirements focused on improving the security around how developers consume OSS into the developer workflow.\\n\\nDue to the fact that OSS makes up 70-90 percent of the code base used by developers,13 and is present in 96 percent of modern applications,14 it has become a crucial dependency in the software industry.\\n\\nMicrosoft had been operating its OSS security and governance program for many years as part of the Microsoft SDL, but expanded its scope to include a holistic view of supply chain security in 2019, now called the S2C2F.\\n\\nWe continue to maintain the framework within the Supply Chain Integrity working group in collaboration with the OpenSSF community. Since the S2C2F is a consumption-focused framework, it can be used in addition to existing secure development practices. The S2C2F requirements have also been organized into a maturity model, enabling organizations to prioritize what requirements they should implement first.

Leveraging automation presents an opportunity to fulfill these obligations at a reduced cost and lower impact on engineers.\\n\\n| Tm | Pa | Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles |\\n|----|----|-------------------------------------|\\n| Dp |    | mapping index on page 124           |\\n\\n## Microsoft\\'s secure-by-design supply chain\\n\\n### Celebrating 20 years of the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)\\n\\nWe prioritize security in every aspect of our products and services to ensure resilience. The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), introduced in 2004, is designed to identify and minimize risks throughout the product lifecycle, meet compliance requirements, and deliver reliable solutions to our customers.8\\n\\nWe have evolved the SDL to adapt to cloud computing, AI/ML advancements, the changing threat landscape, and regulatory demands like US Executive Order 14028 (\"Improving the Nation\\'s Cybersecurity\"). Our latest SDL updates focus on simplicity, automation, and providing developers with further guidance and guardrails.\\n\\nWe leverage enforcement mechanisms within our development and cloud platforms to impose SDL requirements early in the development lifecycle. For example, we scan code for potential exposure of sensitive information before it is committed to version control and ensure that code is reviewed by someone other than the author before being committed.\\n\\nWe also invest in finding vulnerable code across our products and services. CodeQL is a powerful static analysis tool which we use to identify security issues and potential vulnerabilities in programming languages. We centrally store source code snapshots generated at build time in CodeQL Central and run predefined rules or ad hoc queries against them. These rules help identify known vulnerable code patterns, capture evidence of secure coding practices, and highlight areas affected by emerging requirements like Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).\\n\\nOur approach has significantly reduced the feedback loop when new vulnerabilities are discovered, providing actionable results to developers within hours. When these CodeQL rules mature or require urgent release, as in the case of Solarwinds,9 we open-source them and incorporate them into the CodeQL product to benefit all users.\\n\\nWhile automation plays a vital role, we also prioritize developer security training, threat modelling, and specialized reviews in areas like AI/ML and cryptography. These efforts provide knowledge which feeds back into our SDL guidance and automation, allowing us to scale while ensuring security. We also share knowledge externally through published guidance, open-sourced tools, and new features in our developer and cloud platforms to foster a more collaborative and resilient environment for all.\\n\\n| Pr | Em | Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles |\\n|----|----|------------------------------------|\\n|    |    | mapping index on page 124          |', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6272682782979735), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='a6e8edad-204c-4c95-9944-908fc30b8519', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 123}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='# Building cybersecurity capacity through the Cyber Development Goals\\n\\nThis report highlights the latest cyberthreat trends and showcases the innovative technologies that are being used to address them. But to secure long-term resilience, defenses must be leveraged across the globe, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that lack sufficient cybersecurity. To achieve this, we must integrate cybersecurity capacity building into global sustainable development efforts.\\n\\nWhile the role of technology is prioritized in international discussions around sustainable development, cybersecurity is often overlooked, despite its crucial role in maintaining a safe and secure digital ecosystem. Microsoft has partnered with the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, and the International Telecommunication Union in a project that aims to secure the adoption of universal cybersecurity goals and targets—the Cyber Development Goals. Inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the objective is to establish essential technical, legal, and policy frameworks to help all countries implement global cybersecurity norms.\\n\\n| Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles mapping index on page 125.\\n\\nThe project will mobilize global resources and facilitate international cooperation to strengthen cybersecurity capacity building efforts.\\n\\nThroughout 2023, we convened experts to create a multistakeholder community dedicated to promoting cybersecurity capacity building for a safe and secure digital transformation worldwide. Key initiatives include supporting the development of national cybersecurity strategies, establishing computer security incident response teams or emergency response teams, building technical and forensic expertise, enhancing critical infrastructure resilience, and developing frameworks for incident response.\\n\\nMicrosoft is investing in concrete efforts to improve global cybersecurity resilience. We have launched several initiatives focused on raising awareness, fostering information and expertise exchange on effective policies and approaches to cybersecurity. One example is our partnership with the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Africa, which seeks to improve the overall cybersecurity posture of the continent.

It includes the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform, developer identities, and all connected services used by our developers (such as Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces). The model was informed by real-world threat reports and calculated risk scores. Based on the results, we made several security investments: adopting secure boot for our build machines, improving inventory and update processes for build tools, and validating the integrity of our software bills of materials (SBOMs) at release time.\\n\\nOur security measures go beyond just identity, devices, and access. We follow Zero Trust principles to secure our developers. This includes using phish-resistant MFA, requiring managed healthy devices to access DevOps web apps, replacing personal access tokens (PAT) bearer tokens with managed identities, and applying the least privilege access principle to managing version control and build configuration. We also perform periodic user access reviews to ensure privileges are only granted to those with a business need and use just-in-time (JIT) permission controls for administration tasks.\\n\\n### How our SDL and development infrastructure security come together\\n\\nProducing trustworthy software requires trustworthy development infrastructure.\\n\\n| Dependencies | Source integrity | Build integrity | Release integrity | SDL |\\n|--------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|\\n| Consumer | Dependencies | Artifact stores | | S2C2F |\\n| Access | Device & Identity | | | Zero trust principles |\\n| | Physical devices | Virtual devices | User accounts | Service accounts |\\n| | Secure Configuration | Secure Monitoring | Incident Response | |\\n| | Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) | | | |\\n\\n## Our approach to open-source governance\\n\\nMicrosoft relies heavily on open source in its supply chain, with over 83,000 unique packages used more than 13 million times in our products. To encourage collaboration, we have created an environment that allows developers to choose the best open source for their needs, without outdated pre-approved lists or manual reviews.\\n\\nIt is crucial to ensure we use open source safely and efficiently. We have invested in an internal tool that continuously inventories open source, flags license concerns, and alerts developers to vulnerabilities.\\n\\nThis tool is available to customers on Azure DevOps through GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps.\\n\\n### Additional information\\n\\nEmbrace proactive security with Zero Trust | Microsoft\\nManaged identities for Azure resources | Microsoft\\n\\n### 83,000\\n\\nunique packages used more than 13 million times in our products', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6210860891284743), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='a2bd510a-2756-4c54-8d29-6186b2e24c93', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 100}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='# Responding with breakthrough innovation continued\\n\\nExperiences based on large language models, like ChatGPT, have taken the world by storm in the last year. This is in part because they can draw upon a vast store of data, leveraging the massive computing power available today in the cloud. But what I think is more exciting is the real, tangible impact that technology like this can drive. AI, together with the power of cloud and machine learning, has enormous potential. Much like we led the charge on password spray detection, two-factor authentication enforcement, and managed device health, we have an opportunity to demonstrate how responsible AI has the potential to positively transform the security landscape.\\n\\nAt Microsoft, we are developing first- and third-party solutions for our ever-increasing number of enterprise, government, and consumer customers and partners. We have seen developer activity double in the last three years, and it is up by over 31 percent in the last year alone. This trend will accelerate as developers adopt AI powered development tools like GitHub Copilot. This will require a commensurate increase in threat models, code reviews, compliance attestations, and app/ infrastructure assurance to secure resilience.\\n\\nAn important contribution we can make is to continue to evolve our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) rules and engineering compliance. This will ensure continued focus on secure engineering practices.\\n\\nWe recently simplified, updated, and automated our SDL and Operational Security Assurance requirements into a single standard. We will increase our compliance with the modernized SDL through enhanced training, automation, and reporting.\\n\\nWe will also deploy Security CoPilot—our new AI powered incident response assistant—across our incident response teams, so that we can both gain the benefit of AI in addressing security incidents, and so we can improve this valuable new capability by providing our development teams with feedback based on our real-world experience.\\n\\nBased on actions needed to meet the growing threat landscape, our approach for the next year will focus on bringing to bear AI in combating threats while also embracing the three SDL principles of Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure in Deployment (SD3). While it may sound simple, this will require all of us to prioritize and collaborate to successfully execute across everything we do, every day.\\n\\nBret Arsenault\\nChief Information Security Officer\\n\\n## We have defined three priority areas in which we will invest to ensure that we embed SD3:\\n\\n1. Be Secure by Design and address the technical debt. Bring systems up to current standards and levels of inspection and security. Address the need for security training for developers, threat modeling for all services, complete Code QL and Network Security.\\n\\n2. Create efficiency in current systems. Unify critical tools and systems, including the numerous Identity systems, SOC/IR, case management, and risk management. Create common tooling and mechanisms to ensure compliance with Secure by Default and Secure in Deployment.\\n\\n3. Future-proof the company, focusing on AI. We need to invest resources in how we identify the new risks (Secure by Design) and operate the environments (Secure by Default and Secure in Deployment). We will leverage AI to improve security operations and define the standards to ensure we build trust and transparency across all the customer facing implementations as well.\\n\\n| 23% |\\n|-----|\\n| annual rise in the cases processed by the Microsoft Security Response Center and Security Operations Center teams. |', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6158931703134074)]\n",

As the market is changing, governments are moving toward mandatory requirements, where noncompliance could result in losing access to a market segment or financial penalties.\\n\\nThese requirements will create significant market pressure on IoT and OT device manufacturers to adopt cybersecurity best practices.\\n\\nIn the United States, the Biden administration announced a voluntary cyber labeling program for smart devices to protect American consumers intended to be \"up and running\" in 2024. The program will evaluate products against criteria NIST develops, such as the consumer IoT core baseline profile NIST IR 8425 published in September 2022 and requirements for consumer grade routers to be completed by the end of 2023. The US National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan set a completion date prior to November 2023 for the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to propose Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements for procurement of IoT devices by US federal agencies.\\n\\nThe UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill empowers government ministers to specify security requirements for consumer connectable products with which businesses involved in making the products available to UK consumers must comply. Draft security requirements for connectable products have been published, and the UK\\'s consumer connectable products security regime will come into effect on April 29, 2024. The security requirements mandate that manufacturers stop using default passwords in products, establish a vulnerability disclosure policy, and provide transparency about the minimum length of time that the product will receive security updates. While US and UK efforts are focused on consumer products, we believe they will drive improved security in the OT market as well.\\n\\nThe EU delegated act to the Radio Equipment Directive will enforce mandatory security requirements in mid-2024 for wireless devices with the goals of improving network resilience, protecting consumers\\' privacy, and reducing the risk of monetary fraud. Cybersecurity requirements in the Radio Equipment Directive are likely to be overshadowed by the proposed EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), anticipated to be finalized in 2024. Microsoft believes the CRA could have serious implications for product cybersecurity, similar to how the EU General Data Protection Regulation promulgated privacy requirements. The CRA envisions mandatory essential cybersecurity requirements for nearly all connected products with digital elements to be sold in the European Union, including hardware, standalone software, and associated remote data processing. Requirements are structured to improve security throughout the lifecycle of products, including design, development, and support. The CRA includes conformity assessment and product security labeling through the application of the European CE marking system.\\n\\n## Additional information\\n\\n- The UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure | Product Security | UK Government\\n- Commission statement on wireless devices and products | European Commission\\n- Biden-Harris Administration Announces Cybersecurity Labeling Program for Smart Devices to Protect American Consumers | The White House\\n- IR 8425 Profile of the IoT Core Baseline for Consumer IoT Products | NIST\\n- National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan | The White House\\n- Adopting guidance from the US National Cybersecurity Strategy to secure the Internet of Things | Microsoft\\n- New EU cybersecurity rules ensure more secure hardware and software products | European Commission', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6211704440508434), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='6888ebb4-63ad-4da1-9acf-98502d7211d3', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 110}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='# Collective Defense\\n\\n## Key developments\\n\\nBy forging strong partnerships that transcend borders, industries, and the public-private divide, we are creating a united front against cybercrime.\\n\\nAs cyberthreats evolve, productive relationships across a spectrum of stakeholders will be essential to improve threat intelligence, drive resilience, and contribute to mitigation guidance.\\n\\n| The fragmented cybersecurity landscape means we are not making the most of the vast amount of threat intelligence and data that is available. |\\n|---|\\n| The new Cybercrime Atlas will maximize global data collection while ensuring intelligence is thoroughly cleansed, enriched, and vetted by experts from diverse industries. |\\n| Find out more on page 111 |\\n\\n| Fewer than 15% of NGOs have cybersecurity experts on their staff. |\\n|---|\\n| The CyberPeace Institute is providing critical support and assistance to humanitarian organizations. |\\n| Find out more on page 121 |\\n\\nA ground-breaking lawsuit aimed at ending the illicit use of Cobalt Strike shows the power of uniting efforts to identify and take down criminal infrastructure.\\n\\n| 75% of eligible citizens in democratic nations have the opportunity to vote in the next year and a half.

This is in part because they can draw upon a vast store of data, leveraging the massive computing power available today in the cloud. But what I think is more exciting is the real, tangible impact that technology like this can drive. AI, together with the power of cloud and machine learning, has enormous potential. Much like we led the charge on password spray detection, two-factor authentication enforcement, and managed device health, we have an opportunity to demonstrate how responsible AI has the potential to positively transform the security landscape.\\n\\nAt Microsoft, we are developing first- and third-party solutions for our ever-increasing number of enterprise, government, and consumer customers and partners. We have seen developer activity double in the last three years, and it is up by over 31 percent in the last year alone. This trend will accelerate as developers adopt AI powered development tools like GitHub Copilot. This will require a commensurate increase in threat models, code reviews, compliance attestations, and app/ infrastructure assurance to secure resilience.\\n\\nAn important contribution we can make is to continue to evolve our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) rules and engineering compliance. This will ensure continued focus on secure engineering practices.\\n\\nWe recently simplified, updated, and automated our SDL and Operational Security Assurance requirements into a single standard. We will increase our compliance with the modernized SDL through enhanced training, automation, and reporting.\\n\\nWe will also deploy Security CoPilot—our new AI powered incident response assistant—across our incident response teams, so that we can both gain the benefit of AI in addressing security incidents, and so we can improve this valuable new capability by providing our development teams with feedback based on our real-world experience.\\n\\nBased on actions needed to meet the growing threat landscape, our approach for the next year will focus on bringing to bear AI in combating threats while also embracing the three SDL principles of Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure in Deployment (SD3). While it may sound simple, this will require all of us to prioritize and collaborate to successfully execute across everything we do, every day.\\n\\nBret Arsenault\\nChief Information Security Officer\\n\\n## We have defined three priority areas in which we will invest to ensure that we embed SD3:\\n\\n1. Be Secure by Design and address the technical debt. Bring systems up to current standards and levels of inspection and security. Address the need for security training for developers, threat modeling for all services, complete Code QL and Network Security.\\n\\n2. Create efficiency in current systems. Unify critical tools and systems, including the numerous Identity systems, SOC/IR, case management, and risk management. Create common tooling and mechanisms to ensure compliance with Secure by Default and Secure in Deployment.\\n\\n3. Future-proof the company, focusing on AI. We need to invest resources in how we identify the new risks (Secure by Design) and operate the environments (Secure by Default and Secure in Deployment).

Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\\'s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\\n\\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\\n\\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\'s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\\n\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\n\\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\n\\n## Seasonality\\n\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\n\\n## Change in Accounting Estimate\\n\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6301600325284636), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='8251a3d6-c338-458c-a621-db84f62a0350', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 32}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n# OPERATIONAL RISKS\\n\\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\\n\\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\\n\\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\\n\\n# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\\n\\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct.

This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.\\n\\nSome users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to combat these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage.\\n\\n# RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\\n\\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\\n\\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\\n\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies' ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n25\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6183783045621328)]\n",

These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\\n\\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.\\n\\nWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.\\n\\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6187389199118387), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='97a7d233-1bd1-4351-b6a6-746de779a5a9', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 33}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\nFor example, the European Commission (\"the Commission\") closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws.\\n\\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\\n\\nCompetition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value.\\n\\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\"Anti-Corruption Laws\") prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\\n\\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\\n\\n31', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6116092579225317), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='c3765528-a220-4613-a0bc-cd7f9769e5f3', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 38}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.\\n\\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\\n\\n36', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6098606037677935), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='a542bf20-85a1-4302-9384-c775633b5152', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 43}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART II\\nItem 7\\n\\n# Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\\n\\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\\'s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\\n\\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\\n\\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\'s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\\n\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\n\\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\n\\n## Seasonality\\n\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\n\\n## Change in Accounting Estimate\\n\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6084318142340277), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='8251a3d6-c338-458c-a621-db84f62a0350', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 32}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n# OPERATIONAL RISKS\\n\\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\\n\\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\\n\\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\\n\\n# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\\n\\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.607139023923186)]\n",

Generally speaking, the lower the resources and effort involved, the higher the return on mitigation (ROM). As an example of a high return, consider a simple solution to implement: context-based MFA protection. This solution is highly effective in preventing initial access (high security value) but very simple to implement (low effort).

This is in part because they can draw upon a vast store of data, leveraging the massive computing power available today in the cloud. But what I think is more exciting is the real, tangible impact that technology like this can drive. AI, together with the power of cloud and machine learning, has enormous potential. Much like we led the charge on password spray detection, two-factor authentication enforcement, and managed device health, we have an opportunity to demonstrate how responsible AI has the potential to positively transform the security landscape.\\n\\nAt Microsoft, we are developing first- and third-party solutions for our ever-increasing number of enterprise, government, and consumer customers and partners. We have seen developer activity double in the last three years, and it is up by over 31 percent in the last year alone. This trend will accelerate as developers adopt AI powered development tools like GitHub Copilot. This will require a commensurate increase in threat models, code reviews, compliance attestations, and app/ infrastructure assurance to secure resilience.\\n\\nAn important contribution we can make is to continue to evolve our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) rules and engineering compliance. This will ensure continued focus on secure engineering practices.\\n\\nWe recently simplified, updated, and automated our SDL and Operational Security Assurance requirements into a single standard. We will increase our compliance with the modernized SDL through enhanced training, automation, and reporting.\\n\\nWe will also deploy Security CoPilot—our new AI powered incident response assistant—across our incident response teams, so that we can both gain the benefit of AI in addressing security incidents, and so we can improve this valuable new capability by providing our development teams with feedback based on our real-world experience.\\n\\nBased on actions needed to meet the growing threat landscape, our approach for the next year will focus on bringing to bear AI in combating threats while also embracing the three SDL principles of Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure in Deployment (SD3). While it may sound simple, this will require all of us to prioritize and collaborate to successfully execute across everything we do, every day.\\n\\nBret Arsenault\\nChief Information Security Officer\\n\\n## We have defined three priority areas in which we will invest to ensure that we embed SD3:\\n\\n1.

Third-party satellite systems, like SpaceX's Starlink and SES' O3b constellation, can be employed.[54][55]\\n\\nSES plans to use Microsoft's data centers to provide cloud connectivity to remote areas through its next generation O3b mPOWER MEO satellites alongside Microsoft's data centers.[56] The company will deploy satellite control and uplink ground stations to achieve this. SES launched the first two O3b mPOWER satellites in December 2022; nine more are scheduled between 2023 and 2024. The service should begin in Q3 2023.[57]\\n\\nAccording to Microsoft, using satellites to connect to cloud data centers may provide faster speeds than complex fiber routes. For online media, entertainment, or gaming activities, connecting from home to the cloud can involve longer routes with multiple hops. Through their experiments with Xbox Cloud, Microsoft has discovered that satellite connections are faster than terrestrial networks in certain parts of the world, including specific locations in the USA.[58]\\n\\n## Azure Container Storage\\n\\nIn August 2024, Azure introduced the industry's first platform-managed container-native storage solution in the public cloud. This service supports Ephemeral Disks (Local NVMe/Temp SSD) and Azure Disks, offering a robust storage solution tailored for containerized applications.[59]\\n\\n## Azure Quantum\\n\\nReleased for public preview in 2021.

A comprehensive and up-to-date list of these services is available on the Microsoft Azure Trust Center Compliance page.[98] Microsoft Azure received JAB Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the U.S. government under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) guidelines. This program provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud services used by the federal government.[99]\\n\\n# Security\\n\\nIn July 2023, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden called on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Justice Department, and the Federal Trade Commission to hold Microsoft accountable for what he described as \"negligent cybersecurity practices.\" This came in the wake of an alleged cyberattack orchestrated by Chinese hackers, who exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft\\'s software to compromise U.S. government email systems.[100] Similarly, Amit Yoran, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Tenable, Inc., lambasted Microsoft for what he termed \"grossly irresponsible\" actions, accusing the company of fostering a \"culture of toxic obfuscation.\"[101] The Cyber Safety Review Board produced a report that blamed Microsoft about a cascade of security failures that allowed the intrusion to succeed.

The program will evaluate products against criteria NIST develops, such as the consumer IoT core baseline profile NIST IR 8425 published in September 2022 and requirements for consumer grade routers to be completed by the end of 2023. The US National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan set a completion date prior to November 2023 for the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to propose Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements for procurement of IoT devices by US federal agencies.\\n\\nThe UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill empowers government ministers to specify security requirements for consumer connectable products with which businesses involved in making the products available to UK consumers must comply. Draft security requirements for connectable products have been published, and the UK\\'s consumer connectable products security regime will come into effect on April 29, 2024. The security requirements mandate that manufacturers stop using default passwords in products, establish a vulnerability disclosure policy, and provide transparency about the minimum length of time that the product will receive security updates. While US and UK efforts are focused on consumer products, we believe they will drive improved security in the OT market as well.\\n\\nThe EU delegated act to the Radio Equipment Directive will enforce mandatory security requirements in mid-2024 for wireless devices with the goals of improving network resilience, protecting consumers\\' privacy, and reducing the risk of monetary fraud. Cybersecurity requirements in the Radio Equipment Directive are likely to be overshadowed by the proposed EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), anticipated to be finalized in 2024. Microsoft believes the CRA could have serious implications for product cybersecurity, similar to how the EU General Data Protection Regulation promulgated privacy requirements. The CRA envisions mandatory essential cybersecurity requirements for nearly all connected products with digital elements to be sold in the European Union, including hardware, standalone software, and associated remote data processing. Requirements are structured to improve security throughout the lifecycle of products, including design, development, and support. The CRA includes conformity assessment and product security labeling through the application of the European CE marking system.\\n\\n## Additional information\\n\\n- The UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure | Product Security | UK Government\\n- Commission statement on wireless devices and products | European Commission\\n- Biden-Harris Administration Announces Cybersecurity Labeling Program for Smart Devices to Protect American Consumers | The White House\\n- IR 8425 Profile of the IoT Core Baseline for Consumer IoT Products | NIST\\n- National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan | The White House\\n- Adopting guidance from the US National Cybersecurity Strategy to secure the Internet of Things | Microsoft\\n- New EU cybersecurity rules ensure more secure hardware and software products | European Commission', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6605755395759048), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='0513dabd-ede4-4522-82e0-f4bc006ad521', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 89}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Improving global infrastructure resilience continued\\n\\nThe European Union, Japan, Mexico, and the United States each engaged in notable activity during the past year to advance cross-sector or sector-specific initiatives to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity.

A security directive mandated passenger and freight railroad carriers to develop network segmentation controls, implement access control measures, use continuous monitoring and detection, and apply security patches promptly to ensure safe operation of operational technology systems in case of IT system incidents. | The EU implemented NIS2, CER, and DORA to enhance critical infrastructure resilience against cyber and physical threats. NIS2 mandates incident response, crisis management, cybersecurity risk management, hygiene, and training. CER strengthens critical infrastructure resilience to various threats. DORA requires financial entities to report incidents, conduct testing, and monitor third-party risks. It also oversees \"critical\" ICT third-party service providers. EU member states must transpose NIS2 and CER by October 2024 and apply DORA by January 2025. | TSA further increased cybersecurity requirements, including TSA-regulated airports and aircraft operators. In July, TSA revised and reissued its cybersecurity requirements for oil and natural gas pipelines starting in 2022. | Japan approved the General Policy for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure. The General Policy provides guidance to ministries responsible for critical infrastructure industries for designating systems as critical infrastructure and regulating their cybersecurity risk management practices. The policy and corresponding standards for each of the critical infrastructure sectors are not expected to come into effect until 2024. | The Security Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose material cyber incidents within four days and describe their nature, scope, timing and impact. The rule also requires a company to describe its processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and describe its board of director\\'s oversight of cybersecurity risks. |\\n\\nMexico\\'s Federal Congress introduced a bill for a new Federal Law on Cybersecurity. It aims to establish a regulatory framework for critical information infrastructures (CII) and would create a national cybersecurity agency supporting risk analysis, collaboration with CII operators, maintaining a national CII catalog, monitoring security policies, and defining standardized security measures.

At Microsoft, as we work to create a future for everyone, we have a responsibility to support people's digital safety and defend against the challenges presented by technologically enabled bad actors. We also need to uphold human rights, close divides, and partner on collaborative initiatives protecting people and systems' digital security.\\n\\nAcross the globe, Microsoft works closely with our customers and partners to provide security guidance and tools to improve cyber resilience and protect the integrity of digital services, especially in the face of ever-evolving threats. For example, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center released a report highlighting the increase in Russia's espionage attacks and their development of new forms of ransomware in March 2023, and Microsoft announced its investigation of an Iranian cyberattack against Albania's government in September 2022. Cybercriminals and threat actors are constantly innovating their strategies to leverage technological advancements—but so are we. Working together and providing industry-leading solutions are core to our collective defense efforts.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we offer insights into our collective defense strategies, including support for the World Economic Forum's Cybercrime Atlas initiative and engagement in the Open Source Security Foundation. We also highlight strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations to overcome attacks like Volt Typhoon and combat the illicit use of tools like Cobalt Strike. From our role as a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) to our partnership with TruePic to create Project Providence, we show how we're working together in new ways to bolster our customers' digital defense capabilities, reduce their cyber risks, and further collaborative projects, such as documenting evidence of cultural heritage site destruction in Ukraine. As part of our commitment to defending democracy, Microsoft's non-partisan election protection efforts extend globally through work with organizations like the International Foundation for Election Systems, to help weave far-reaching networks that enable the sharing of best practices. Our partnerships to protect elections span work with nonprofits including the National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, and Freedom House. These are just a few of the many ways in which Microsoft is working cooperatively with leading organizations on innovative solutions to best meet the challenges facing our world today. We are proud to collaborate with other leading technology companies and cross-sector partners to advance open-source security, curb cybercrime, safeguard democracy, and strengthen media content.\\n\\nMicrosoft remains committed to supporting a healthy information ecosystem and addressing evolving threats within the digital spaces in which we operate. Core to this work are diverse strategic partnerships and trained cybersecurity professionals.\\n\\nThe shortage of cybersecurity professionals and the need for AI skills, as discussed in depth later in this chapter, pose significant challenges in today's rapidly changing digital landscape. Robust partnerships with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, governments, and other businesses are central to our collective defense efforts and skill-building resources that can enable people to adapt amidst constantly shifting challenges. As the threat landscape evolves, we look forward to continuing these and other collective defense engagements with valued partners.\\n\\nTeresa Hutson\\nCorporate Vice President, Technology for Fundamental Rights\\n\\n> Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles mapping index on page 125.\\n\\nThough threats to the information ecosystem have always existed, the tactics adversaries deploy in the digital age are constantly evolving.

Achieving this will require a collective global effort as we harness the power of partnership to strengthen our defenses together.\\n\\nStrength in numbers. Stronger together. Together we stand. Societies around the world recognize the benefits of collective behavior. The power of multistakeholder partnerships in cybersecurity, too, cannot be ignored as we seek to answer the question, \"What we can do to ensure a more safe and secure world for everyone on the planet?\"\\n\\nIndividual organizations are often focused on safeguarding their own data and systems and protecting their customers, constituents, and communities.\\n\\nBut partnerships act as a force multiplier for everyone involved in cybersecurity. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders—including government agencies, private sector entities, academia, non-profits, and other organizations—are crucial in building resilient defenses against cyber threats.\\n\\n## The cyber poverty line\\n\\nTo understand the need for collaboration, it is useful to consider the concept of a \"cyber poverty line.\" In the same way that governments and economists establish a social poverty line to determine a bare minimum standard of living, the cyber poverty line is the minimum level of resources required for adequate protection from cyber threats. As we ponder the implication of the existence of a cyber poverty line, important questions begin to surface. How, exactly, do we quantify the cyber poverty line? Who is below it and how can we work together to support them to rise above it? These questions underscore the imperative of partnership in cybersecurity and serve as the genesis of meaningful conversations we must have.\\n\\n## Public-private partnerships, policy, and standards\\n\\nThe opportunities for partnership across the public and private sectors, policy organizations, and standards bodies are multi-dimensional. From ensuring the technology community is building safer, more secure technology and collaborating on threat intelligence and trends to developing common standards to take down and block the tools cybercriminals use, strong and bi-directional partnerships between organizations are crucial.\\n\\nAs much as any individual company\\'s shareholders would like it to be so, no one technology company can solve or overcome every cybersecurity challenge. Partnerships across the technology community are an absolute necessity to ensure organizations of all types and sizes, in every industry and region, can protect themselves. This means working together to push the boundaries of innovation, ensuring technical integration of products in the security space and addressing the end-to-end security needs of customers.\\n\\n## Non-profit, academia, and research\\n\\nNon-profit, academia, and research organizations play a crucial role in advancing cybersecurity. By collaborating with industry partners, they bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Academic institutions contribute to cybersecurity research, develop innovative technologies, and educate the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. Collaborative research projects and initiatives between academia, non-profits, and industry promote innovation and help tackle emerging cyber threats effectively.\\n\\nIt is essential that stakeholders recognize their shared responsibility and actively engage in partnerships that enhance cybersecurity. History has already shown that by working together, we can build a safer digital future for individuals, organizations and nations—but there is so much more to be done.\\n\\n> For more about the power of partnerships, please see the Collective Defense chapter on page 108.\\n\\n## The concept of a cyber poverty line allows us to identify the minimum level of resources required for adequate protection from cyber threats and who we must support to rise above it.\\n\\n### Additional information\\n\\nCollaboration is crucial to strengthening cybersecurity | Microsoft On the Issues', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.5958917822547517), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='1a14cc60-0607-4d13-9b31-22665f04552f', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 113}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"# Collective intelligence and defense against Volt Typhoon\\n\\nCollaboration between the cybersecurity industry and government research organizations is crucial to understand and overcome common adversaries. As cyberthreats evolve, trusted relationships improve collective knowledge, drive resilience, and inform mitigation guidance across the security ecosystem on a global scale.\\n\\nMicrosoft's unparalleled visibility of the threat landscape provides us with unique insight. To extend this visibility, we have developed a community of strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations as we aim to more fully understand and defend against common adversaries. These partnerships which span across the security industry and government research organizations from around the world have become a crucial part of our threat hunting process. The mutual benefit to both parties adds unique value that improves our ability to protect our shared customers.\\n\\nAs part of our analysis of Volt Typhoon attacks against organizations in Guam and the United States, these partnerships helped us expand and analyze more deeply the telemetry we were seeing within our customer environments. Working across private industry to share our research and extending this visibility to government partners then allowed us to rapidly understand the real and potential impact of Volt Typhoon activity and craft a collective response.

Enforce access restrictions by implementing segregation of privileges and least privilege access and utilize privileged access workstations (PAWs) to manage identity systems. |\\n| Insufficient privilege access and lateral movement controls | To enhance resilience and limit the scope of an attack, secure and restrict administrative access. Utilize Privileged Access Management controls, such as just-in-time access and just-enough administration. Avoid synchronizing on-premises administrative accounts with the cloud and vice versa. |\\n| Low maturity security operations | A comprehensive threat detection strategy requires investments in extended detection and response (XDR) and modern cloud native tools employing machine learning to separate noise from signals. Modernize security operations tools by incorporating XDR that can provide deep security insights across the digital landscape. |\\n| Limited adoption of modern security frameworks | Zero Trust frameworks enforce concepts of least privilege, explicit verification of all access, and always assume compromise. Organizations should also implement security controls and practices in DevOps and application lifecycle processes for higher assurance levels in their business systems. |\\n| No multifactor authentication (MFA) or lack of modern MFA mechanisms | MFA is a critical and fundamental user access control that all organizations should enable. Coupled with conditional access and modern MFA mechanisms, MFA can be invaluable in fighting cyber threats. |\\n| Lack of information protection control | Identify your critical business data and where it is located.

For example, we scan code for potential exposure of sensitive information before it is committed to version control and ensure that code is reviewed by someone other than the author before being committed.\\n\\nWe also invest in finding vulnerable code across our products and services. CodeQL is a powerful static analysis tool which we use to identify security issues and potential vulnerabilities in programming languages. We centrally store source code snapshots generated at build time in CodeQL Central and run predefined rules or ad hoc queries against them. These rules help identify known vulnerable code patterns, capture evidence of secure coding practices, and highlight areas affected by emerging requirements like Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).\\n\\nOur approach has significantly reduced the feedback loop when new vulnerabilities are discovered, providing actionable results to developers within hours. When these CodeQL rules mature or require urgent release, as in the case of Solarwinds,9 we open-source them and incorporate them into the CodeQL product to benefit all users.\\n\\nWhile automation plays a vital role, we also prioritize developer security training, threat modelling, and specialized reviews in areas like AI/ML and cryptography. These efforts provide knowledge which feeds back into our SDL guidance and automation, allowing us to scale while ensuring security. We also share knowledge externally through published guidance, open-sourced tools, and new features in our developer and cloud platforms to foster a more collaborative and resilient environment for all.\\n\\n| Pr | Em | Cybersecurity Tech Accord principles |\\n|----|----|------------------------------------|\\n|    |    | mapping index on page 124          |', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6312431732275312), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='f78ba917-698d-4ebf-8bf3-e31c12744217', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 92}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Innovating for supply chain resilience continued\\n\\n## Securing the development infrastructure\\n\\nWe built a threat model of our end-to-end DevOps environment in 2023 to identify potential threats and prioritize security investments to reduce risk within the engineering ecosystem. It includes the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platform, developer identities, and all connected services used by our developers (such as Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces). The model was informed by real-world threat reports and calculated risk scores. Based on the results, we made several security investments: adopting secure boot for our build machines, improving inventory and update processes for build tools, and validating the integrity of our software bills of materials (SBOMs) at release time.\\n\\nOur security measures go beyond just identity, devices, and access. We follow Zero Trust principles to secure our developers. This includes using phish-resistant MFA, requiring managed healthy devices to access DevOps web apps, replacing personal access tokens (PAT) bearer tokens with managed identities, and applying the least privilege access principle to managing version control and build configuration. We also perform periodic user access reviews to ensure privileges are only granted to those with a business need and use just-in-time (JIT) permission controls for administration tasks.\\n\\n### How our SDL and development infrastructure security come together\\n\\nProducing trustworthy software requires trustworthy development infrastructure.\\n\\n| Dependencies | Source integrity | Build integrity | Release integrity | SDL |\\n|--------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|\\n| Consumer | Dependencies | Artifact stores | | S2C2F |\\n| Access | Device & Identity | | | Zero trust principles |\\n| | Physical devices | Virtual devices | User accounts | Service accounts |\\n| | Secure Configuration | Secure Monitoring | Incident Response | |\\n| | Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) | | | |\\n\\n## Our approach to open-source governance\\n\\nMicrosoft relies heavily on open source in its supply chain, with over 83,000 unique packages used more than 13 million times in our products. To encourage collaboration, we have created an environment that allows developers to choose the best open source for their needs, without outdated pre-approved lists or manual reviews.\\n\\nIt is crucial to ensure we use open source safely and efficiently. We have invested in an internal tool that continuously inventories open source, flags license concerns, and alerts developers to vulnerabilities.\\n\\nThis tool is available to customers on Azure DevOps through GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps.\\n\\n### Additional information\\n\\nEmbrace proactive security with Zero Trust | Microsoft\\nManaged identities for Azure resources | Microsoft\\n\\n### 83,000\\n\\nunique packages used more than 13 million times in our products', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6299639598513544), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='e032c48d-36b2-4d92-8983-3b5a967d6fb7', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_ddr.pdf', 'page_num': 42}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='# Return on mitigation: Targeting investment to increase resilience\\n\\nDuring Microsoft Incident Response engagements, customer environments have been found to lack mitigations that range from the simple to the more complex.\\n\\nWhile the goal of all mitigations is to make environments more resilient to cyberattacks, customers may not always have the resources to implement all of them, and a return on mitigation framework is helpful for prioritization. Generally speaking, the lower the resources and effort involved, the higher the return on mitigation (ROM). As an example of a high return, consider a simple solution to implement: context-based MFA protection. This solution is highly effective in preventing initial access (high security value) but very simple to implement (low effort). When implemented, this solution effectively prevents initial access by providing more context around the authentication attempt, such as geographic location and the application used. The additional context can be combined with requiring the user to enter a number (number matching) to complete MFA to further improve sign-in security.\\n\\n## Return on Mitigation scoring methodology\\n\\nReturn on Mitigation score = (3x security value + 2x potential user impact) / Potential ease of implementation\\n\\n| Return on Mitigation score | Type | Percentage of users potentially impacted | Score |\\n|----------------------------|------|------------------------------------------|-------|\\n| 10 - 15 | Higher | Lower impact (<20% of users impacted) | 3 |\\n| 6 - 9 | Medium | Medium impact (Up to 50% users impacted) | 2 |\\n| 2 - 5 | Lower | Higher impact (>50% users impacted) | 1 |\\n\\n| Engagement distribution (%) by major tactic | Score | Potential ease of implementation | Score |\\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------|-------|\\n| 50 - 100 | 3 | Easy to implement (20 hours or less) | 1 |\\n| 25 - 49 | 2 | Medium (20 - 40 hours) | 2 |\\n| 0 - 24 | 1 | Harder (40+ hours) | 3 |\\n\\nWe have calculated ROM values using a formula multiplying the weighted impact of the solution or mitigation by a weighted value of the solution in terms of effectiveness (security value), and factored in the effort involved in implementing the solution.

The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\"DPF\") has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.\\n\\nIn addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\\n\\nOur investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.\\n\\nExisting and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market.\\n\\n32', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7000856871220068), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='1051fa98-ddaa-4729-babb-d20ebb135ae9', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 30}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\\n\\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\\n\\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\\n\\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.\\n\\nAbuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.\\n\\nAdvertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\\n\\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n28', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.667386053402598), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='1177b77c-ef90-4581-8417-9635c4649567', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 29}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n# Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\\' data\\n\\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers\\' decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\\' on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero day\") vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\\' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users\\' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\\'s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.\\n\\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\\' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.\\n\\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\\' computing environments.\\n\\n## Development and deployment of defensive measures\\n\\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\\' systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.

The IoT\\'s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.\\n\\n## Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. \\nWe are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (\"EU\"), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6401074735771314), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='8251a3d6-c338-458c-a621-db84f62a0350', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'msft_10k_2024.pdf', 'page_num': 32}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n\\n# OPERATIONAL RISKS\\n\\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\\n\\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\\n\\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\\n\\n# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\\n\\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China.

At Microsoft, as we work to create a future for everyone, we have a responsibility to support people's digital safety and defend against the challenges presented by technologically enabled bad actors. We also need to uphold human rights, close divides, and partner on collaborative initiatives protecting people and systems' digital security.\\n\\nAcross the globe, Microsoft works closely with our customers and partners to provide security guidance and tools to improve cyber resilience and protect the integrity of digital services, especially in the face of ever-evolving threats. For example, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center released a report highlighting the increase in Russia's espionage attacks and their development of new forms of ransomware in March 2023, and Microsoft announced its investigation of an Iranian cyberattack against Albania's government in September 2022. Cybercriminals and threat actors are constantly innovating their strategies to leverage technological advancements—but so are we. Working together and providing industry-leading solutions are core to our collective defense efforts.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we offer insights into our collective defense strategies, including support for the World Economic Forum's Cybercrime Atlas initiative and engagement in the Open Source Security Foundation. We also highlight strategic partnerships with threat intelligence organizations to overcome attacks like Volt Typhoon and combat the illicit use of tools like Cobalt Strike. From our role as a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) to our partnership with TruePic to create Project Providence, we show how we're working together in new ways to bolster our customers' digital defense capabilities, reduce their cyber risks, and further collaborative projects, such as documenting evidence of cultural heritage site destruction in Ukraine. As part of our commitment to defending democracy, Microsoft's non-partisan election protection efforts extend globally through work with organizations like the International Foundation for Election Systems, to help weave far-reaching networks that enable the sharing of best practices. Our partnerships to protect elections span work with nonprofits including the National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, and Freedom House. These are just a few of the many ways in which Microsoft is working cooperatively with leading organizations on innovative solutions to best meet the challenges facing our world today. We are proud to collaborate with other leading technology companies and cross-sector partners to advance open-source security, curb cybercrime, safeguard democracy, and strengthen media content.\\n\\nMicrosoft remains committed to supporting a healthy information ecosystem and addressing evolving threats within the digital spaces in which we operate. Core to this work are diverse strategic partnerships and trained cybersecurity professionals.\\n\\nThe shortage of cybersecurity professionals and the need for AI skills, as discussed in depth later in this chapter, pose significant challenges in today's rapidly changing digital landscape. Robust partnerships with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, governments, and other businesses are central to our collective defense efforts and skill-building resources that can enable people to adapt amidst constantly shifting challenges.
